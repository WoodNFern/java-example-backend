Idea copied from "Settle Up" (Android App)

* private Blockchain of "good" Friends
* Proof-of-Work ---Improv.---> Majority Vote (Signatures) 

* Everyone can buy stuff (a beer, food, tickets) for others, if someone forgot their money.
* Keep expanditures in private ledger to track debt
* Later on, "good" friend might deny debt 
    -> Signed transaction + validated Blockchain as proof

Reuse Use Case:
* Save meetings into ledger, too.
* "good" friend might deny he heard of it -> ledger as proof
